# Challenge Rubrics: Reverse-engineering Mass-use UI (e.g., WhatsApp)

Submissions will be evaluated based on five key competencies that measure analytical thinking, design execution, and clarity of communication.

| Skill/Competence Focus                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Max Points |
| :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| **Heuristic Evaluation & UX Analysis**       | The designer demonstrates a strong understanding of usability principles (e.g., Nielsen’s heuristics) and accurately identifies key UX issues and successes.                 | 20         |
| **Interface Deconstruction & Documentation** | The app’s UI components, patterns, and flows are clearly broken down and well-documented with annotated visuals or diagrams.                                                 | 20         |
| **Redesign Rationale & Problem-solving**     | The redesigned flow or screen directly addresses identified UX issues with thoughtful, data-driven reasoning and clear justification.                                        | 20         |
| **Design Quality & Prototype Execution**     | The visual design and prototype exhibit consistency, accessibility, and attention to detail. Prototype links (Figma, Sketch, or Framer) are fully functional and accessible. | 25         |
| **Presentation & Communication**             | The overall presentation is well-structured, concise, and visually engaging. The documentation (Google Doc/Notion) effectively communicates design thinking and outcomes.    | 15         |

### **Total: 100 Points**

**Scoring Bands:**

* **90–100 (Outstanding):** Exceptional depth of analysis, professional design fidelity, and crystal-clear communication.
* **75–89 (Strong):** Solid research, clear reasoning, and functional prototype with minor gaps.
* **60–74 (Satisfactory):** Adequate analysis and design execution but limited in depth or polish.
* **Below 60 (Needs Improvement):** Incomplete or poorly structured submission with weak UX insight or missing deliverables.
