# Product Design Challenge: Reverse-engineering Mass-use UI (e.g., WhatsApp)

---

## üß† Challenge Overview

This challenge is designed to help Product Designers develop deep analytical skills by reverse-engineering a mass-use interface. The goal is to deconstruct, understand, and reinterpret the UX patterns and design logic behind products like **WhatsApp, Telegram, Spotify, or Instagram**‚Äîplatforms used by millions daily. You will learn to evaluate usability, consistency, interaction flows, and visual systems while proposing refined improvements grounded in research and logic.

## üìù Challenge Details

### **Title:** Reverse-engineering Mass-use UI (e.g., WhatsApp)

### **Objective:**

To critically analyze the user experience, structure, and design principles of a widely used digital product and present a deconstructed and enhanced redesign proposal.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Select a Mass-use App:** Choose a globally recognized product (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, Spotify, or Uber). The app must have a significant user base and recognizable design system.

2. **Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation:** Using UX heuristics (like Nielsen‚Äôs 10 Usability Principles), assess the app‚Äôs interface. Identify what works well and what doesn‚Äôt.

3. **Deconstruct the Interface:** Break down the app into its key components (e.g., navigation bar, chat list, message composer). Identify recurring patterns and micro-interactions.

4. **Map User Flows:** Document a key flow (e.g., sending a message, starting a voice call, searching for media). Visualize this flow using a diagram or storyboard.

5. **Identify Pain Points:** Highlight areas for improvement, explaining why these create friction or usability challenges.

6. **Redesign One Flow or Screen:** Choose one flow or screen and redesign it to improve the user experience. Focus on clarity, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.

7. **Prototype (Figma, Sketch, or Framer):** Build an interactive prototype showing your redesign. Ensure your link is **accessible** (public or with view-only permissions).

8. **Document Everything:** Present your process and findings in a structured Google Doc or Notion page.
