# Product Design Weekly Challenge

## **Title:** Designing Seamless Onboarding & Invisible UX for a Fintech App

---

### **Description:**

You‚Äôre working as a **Product Designer** with **FinSync**, a fintech startup that helps users manage personal finances, track spending, and automate savings goals. Your design team has identified that user drop-off occurs mostly during the onboarding phase. You‚Äôre tasked to **redesign the onboarding flow** to make it **frictionless, delightful, and invisible** ‚Äî meaning users feel guided without realizing they are being guided.

Your mission is to explore the principles of **Invisible UX** ‚Äî interactions that feel intuitive, effortless, and seamlessly integrated ‚Äî while ensuring new users complete onboarding and engage with the app‚Äôs core feature (automated savings setup) in under 2 minutes.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Begin by researching examples of **great onboarding experiences** and **invisible UX** patterns used in popular apps like Revolut, Notion, or Duolingo.
2. Define the **user flow** for your onboarding journey ‚Äî from account creation to the first successful savings setup.
3. Create **low-fidelity wireframes** to communicate your concept.
4. Translate your wireframes into a **high-fidelity interactive prototype** using **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Framer**.
5. Ensure accessibility and inclusivity principles are considered in your design.
6. Add micro-interactions that enhance delight (e.g., progress indicators, friendly animations, adaptive hints).
7. Prepare a short design case study (1-2 pages) explaining your thought process, design rationale, and how invisible UX was applied.

---

### **Expected Deliverables:**

* **Figma/Sketch/Framer prototype link** (ensure it is set to public access).
* **Design documentation (Google Doc or PDF)** detailing:

  * Design goals and user pain points.
  * User flow diagram.
  * Screens and design decisions.
  * Invisible UX patterns applied.
  * Accessibility considerations.
  * Reflection on the impact of the design.
