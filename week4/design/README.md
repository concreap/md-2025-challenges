# Product Design Week 4 Challenge

### **Challenge Title:** FlowEase — Designing a Seamless Onboarding Experience with Invisible UX

---

### **Description:**

You’ve been hired by **FlowEase**, a growing SaaS startup that helps freelancers manage projects, clients, and payments in one place. The company has noticed that many new users drop off during the onboarding process. You’ve been tasked with **redesigning their onboarding flow** to make it **frictionless, intuitive, and invisible** — meaning users should feel guided naturally without realizing they’re being onboarded.

Your challenge is to design an onboarding experience that feels effortless, personal, and adaptive to different types of users. The experience should blend **micro-interactions, contextual nudges, and progressive disclosure** to help users set up and engage with the platform without cognitive overload.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Conduct quick research on onboarding flows used by top SaaS platforms (e.g., Notion, Slack, Figma, or Airtable).
2. Define **user personas** and identify their key onboarding pain points.
3. Sketch or wireframe the **onboarding flow**, from sign-up to first successful action (e.g., creating a project or sending an invoice).
4. Design **high-fidelity mockups** of the onboarding journey, focusing on:

   * Invisible cues (smart defaults, contextual hints, or tooltips)
   * Emotional design (tone, microcopy, illustrations)
   * Seamless transitions (animations, empty states)
5. Prototype your flow in **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Framer**.
6. Include accessibility considerations (e.g., color contrast, text clarity).

---

### **Expected Deliverables:**

* A **Google Doc link** containing:

  * Design summary and reasoning (1–2 pages max).
  * Description of user persona(s) and problem statement.
  * Explanation of how invisible UX was integrated.
* A **Figma, Sketch, or Framer link** to your prototype.

  * Ensure that your link is **accessible (anyone with the link can view)**.
* Optional: A short Loom or YouTube walkthrough (2–3 mins) explaining your flow.
