# Product Design Weekly Challenge

## Challenge Title

**UI at Scale: Designing Patterns, States, and Flows for Scalable Systems**

## Scenario / Description

You’re part of the **Design Systems Team** at **FlowGrid**, a fast-growing SaaS platform serving thousands of enterprise users. The company is expanding rapidly, and inconsistent UI patterns and state management are causing friction across teams. Your task is to design a **scalable, consistent UI framework** that supports rapid iteration, accessibility, and multi-product consistency.

This week’s challenge focuses on your ability to think in **systems** — building reusable patterns, defining component states, and mapping scalable user flows that adapt to complexity and growth.

---

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Design **reusable UI patterns and components** that scale across different use cases (e.g., forms, dashboards, modals, notifications).
* Define **component states** (default, hover, focus, error, success, disabled) and ensure accessibility compliance.
* Design **flows** that demonstrate how users interact with multiple states within a real product context.
* Present your designs in **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Framer**, showing component documentation and example flows.

---

## Instructions

1. Choose a **product type** (e.g., SaaS dashboard, e-commerce platform, project management tool).
2. Design a **mini design system** that includes at least:

   * Buttons (primary, secondary, destructive, link)
   * Form inputs (text, dropdown, checkbox, radio)
   * Modals / alerts / notifications
   * Cards or content containers
3. Document **component states** (hover, focus, error, disabled, success).
4. Design **two user flows** that demonstrate these components in action (e.g., onboarding, form submission, data filtering).
5. Use a consistent grid, typography scale, and color system to maintain harmony.
6. Present your work in **Figma, Sketch, or Framer** and ensure links are **accessible (view/comment access)**.
7. Prepare a **Google Doc** describing your design decisions, system rules, and scalability considerations.

---

## Expected Deliverables

* **Figma / Sketch / Framer Prototype Link** (accessible).
* **Component Library / Design System Page** showing patterns and states.
* **Two user flows** showcasing component usage.
* **Google Doc** explaining:

  * Component rationale and usage guidelines.
  * State logic and accessibility considerations.
  * Scalability principles (e.g., how patterns adapt to new features).
  * Visual and interaction consistency strategy.

### Notes

* Focus on **scalability, not just beauty** — aim to create a system that can grow with the product.
* Think modularly — small changes should not break larger experiences.
* Accessibility, consistency, and clarity are your key design currencies this week.
